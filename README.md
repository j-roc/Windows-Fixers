Hello. 

This is a collection of .bat/.cmd files that I've created and used daily supporting Windows computers at the enterprise level. 

I was inspired by [dotfiles'](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) brilliant set of OS X fixing scripts. 

There should be something for everyone, hopefully.
